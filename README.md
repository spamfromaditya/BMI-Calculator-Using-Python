# BMI-Calculator-Using-Python-Tkinter

The project is implemented using Python and Tkinter for the GUI. The main script will contain functions to perform the BMI calculation and handle user inputs. Tkinter widgets such as labels, entry fields, buttons, and text areas will be used to create the user interface. Error handling will be implemented to ensure the application handles invalid inputs gracefully. Finally, the BMI interpretation will be displayed based on standard BMI categories.

This project provides a practical application of Python programming and GUI development using Tkinter, while also promoting health awareness by helping users understand their BMI status.
